Privacy Policy for MailScan â€“ AI-based Phishing Detector

Effective Date: [November-30-2024]

Thank you for using the MailScan extension! This privacy policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and protected when you use the MailScan extension.

1. Data Collection
MailScan does not collect or store any personal data from users directly through the extension. However, if you choose to use features that require Google authentication, the extension may request access to your Gmail account data, such as emails, for the purpose of detecting phishing emails. This data is used solely for this purpose and is not shared with any third parties.

2. Data Usage
The extension uses the data accessed through your Gmail account solely to analyze and detect phishing attempts in your emails. The collected data is processed locally on your device and is not sent to any external servers unless explicitly stated.

3. No Sale of Data
We value your privacy. We will never sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties. Your information is used only for the intended purpose of the extension and will not be shared or sold to advertisers, marketers, or other third parties.

4. Third-Party Services
MailScan may use third-party services (e.g., Google APIs) to facilitate the OAuth authentication process or interact with your Gmail account. These third-party services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them. However, we do not send any personal information to these third parties, except when required by the functionality of the extension.

5. Data Security
We take reasonable measures to protect the security of your personal data. However, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot ensure its absolute security.

6. Your Rights
You have the right to access, correct, or delete any data associated with your use of the extension. If you ever wish to revoke access to your Gmail account, you can do so by visiting the Google Account settings page.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. When we update this policy, we will revise the "Effective Date" at the top of this page.
